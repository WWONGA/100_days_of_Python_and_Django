# Logical Operators (and, or AND not)
# Used to combine conditional statement (if, elif AND else)

a = True
b = False

print(a and b)      # False (True if both are True)
print(a or b)       # True (True if one of them is True)
print(not a)        # False (Flips/swap the value, True becomes False and vise versa)
