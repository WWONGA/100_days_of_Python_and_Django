# Day 2 Notes: Variables and Data Types

## Concepts covered:
- Variables and naming conventions
- Basic data types: int, float, str and bool
- Type Conversion using: int(), float() and str()
- Simple arithmetic and user input

## Reflections
- I have learnt how Python automatically detects data types.
- "input()" always returns a string, so conversions are important.
- I wrote my first real user-interactive program.

## Next Steps
- Study Python operators (Day 3): Friday, 16th October 2025
- Practise combining Variables with Logic and Conditions
